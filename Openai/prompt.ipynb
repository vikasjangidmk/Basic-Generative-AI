    "# OpenAI Prompt and Its Types\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Prompt?\n",
    "A **prompt** is the input text or instruction given to an AI model to guide its response. The quality and structure of the prompt significantly affect the model's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Instruction-Based Prompt**\n",
    "   - Provides clear instructions on what the model should do.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**: Task-specific guidance.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```plaintext\n",
    "     Write a short poem about the ocean.\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Open-Ended Prompt**\n",
    "   - Starts a topic or idea without specific instructions, allowing the model to generate creative or exploratory responses.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**: Storytelling, brainstorming, or creative writing.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```plaintext\n",
    "     Once upon a time in a distant galaxy, there was a...\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Contextual Prompt**\n",
    "   - Provides a context or background before asking a question or issuing a task.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**: Continuation of conversations, complex problem-solving.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```plaintext\n",
    "     The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. What happens next?\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Few-Shot Prompt**\n",
    "   - Provides a few examples of input-output pairs to help the model understand the desired format or style.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**: Custom formatting or specific task patterns.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```plaintext\n",
    "     Translate the following English sentences to French:\n",
    "     - Hello, how are you? -> Bonjour, comment Ã§a va?\n",
    "     - I love programming. -> J'adore programmer.\n",
    "     - What is your name? -> Quel est ton nom?\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Zero-Shot Prompt**\n",
    "   - Directly instructs the model to perform a task without providing examples.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**: Quick instructions for general tasks.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```plaintext\n",
    "     Summarize this paragraph in one sentence.\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Chain-of-Thought Prompt**\n",
    "   - Encourages the model to reason step-by-step by explicitly asking for intermediate steps in its reasoning process.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**: Problem-solving, reasoning tasks.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```plaintext\n",
    "     If John has 5 apples and gives 2 to Mary, and then buys 3 more, how many apples does he have? Show your reasoning.\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Role-Based Prompt**\n",
    "   - Assigns the model a specific role to guide its behavior or tone.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**: Simulating experts or specific personas.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```plaintext\n",
    "     You are a math tutor. Explain the Pythagorean theorem in simple terms.\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Custom Task Prompt**\n",
    "   - Tailored for a very specific task or requirement.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**: Applications like coding, debugging, or data analysis.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```plaintext\n",
    "     Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices for Crafting Prompts\n",
    "1. **Be Specific**: Clear instructions lead to better outputs.\n",
    "   - Instead of: \"Explain photosynthesis,\" try: \"Explain photosynthesis to a 12-year-old in 100 words.\"\n",
    "2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant background for the task.\n",
    "   - Example: \"The following text is a scientific paper abstract. Summarize it in plain English.\"\n",
    "3. **Use Examples**: When needed, guide the model with input-output pairs.\n",
    "4. **Iterate**: Test and refine prompts for better performance.\n",
    "5. **Set a Role**: Help the model adopt a suitable tone or behavior.\n",
    "   - Example: \"Act as a professional editor and improve this text for publication.\"\n",

    "# Iterative Prompting and Negative Prompting in OpenAI Models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Iterative Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iterative Prompting** is a technique where prompts are refined in multiple steps based on the model's previous responses. It is particularly useful for complex tasks where the first output may not fully meet expectations. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "1. **Initial Prompt**: Start with a general or basic instruction.\n",
    "2. **Model Response**: Review the output generated by the model.\n",
    "3. **Refine Prompt**: Add more details or constraints to the prompt based on the initial response.\n",
    "4. **Repeat**: Continue refining until the desired output quality is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "1. **Content Refinement**: Improving the quality of creative writing or summaries.\n",
    "2. **Problem Solving**: Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks.\n",
    "3. **Code Debugging**: Iteratively refining code suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "**Task**: Generate a detailed travel itinerary.\n",
    "1. **Initial Prompt**:\n",
    "   ```plaintext\n",
    "   Create a 3-day travel itinerary for Paris.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "# Negative Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Negative Prompting** is a technique used to explicitly instruct AI models on what content, tone, or style to avoid in their responses. It helps refine the output by narrowing down undesired elements while maintaining focus on the desired ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Negative Prompting Works\n",
    "1. **Explicit Exclusions**: Clearly specify what the AI should NOT include.\n",
    "2. **Guided Response**: The model uses this information to avoid generating unwanted elements.\n",
    "3. **Complementary with Positive Instructions**: Negative prompts often work best when combined with positive instructions that clarify what is expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases for Negative Prompting\n",
    "1. **Content Filtering**: Exclude inappropriate, irrelevant, or sensitive topics.\n",
    "2. **Tone and Style Control**: Avoid certain writing styles, tones, or jargons.\n",
    "3. **Focused Content**: Prevent the model from including unnecessary details or going off-topic.\n",
    "4. **Creative Refinement**: Guide creative tasks by eliminating unwanted themes or genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples of Negative Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Excluding Sensitive Content\n",
    "**Task**: Write a story without violence or controversial themes.\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Write a short story about adventure, but avoid including violence or controversial topics.\n"
